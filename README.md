# Zemax_DLLs
Exemplary c code for generating surfaces in Zemax

This repository is an example of source code for user defined surface DLL in Zemax
Basic introduction to those kind of DLLs is given at: https://support.zemax.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005577602-How-to-compile-a-User-Defined-DLL
While reading such a tutorial, I wrote myself Hebrew notes which are part of this reposetory
The example code (DTMLA_V8.c) functional details are deliberately undocumented since its use is proprietary
